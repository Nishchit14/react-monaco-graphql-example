# react-monaco-graphql-example

1. `yarn` to install dependancies and 
2. `yarn start` to start development server
3. `http://localhost:8886/` open in browser

## Problem
GraphQL worker seems not workig as expected. The schema is not being fetched so no dropdown suggestions are shown on `ctrl+space`
